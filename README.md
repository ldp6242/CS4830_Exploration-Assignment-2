Exploration Assignment 2

Decided to do my exploration assignment on Python for a couple of different reasons. After talking to a couple of employers at the career fair. Alot of major companies are looking for this skill so I decided why not learn more about it.  Python is really interesting I overall like it even though I am currently still in the beginning stages. I'm starting to realize there is alot of things I can do with this language. This will be something I continuously build on as I am excited to learn as much as I can about it.

I haven't had that many complications yet as I am still learning the basic syntax of the language.  Once I dive deeper into it I'm pretty sure I will questions coming along. Overall I like it!
