Exploration Assignment 2

Decided to do my exploration assignment on Python for a couple of different reasons. After talking to a couple of employers at the career fair. Alot of major companies are looking for this skill so I decided why not learn more about it.  Python is really interesting I overall like it even though I am currently still in the beginning stages. I'm starting to realize there is alot of things I can do with this language.
